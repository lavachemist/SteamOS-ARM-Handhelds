# DISCLAIMER — USE AT YOUR OWN RISK

**Read this entire document before running any script in this folder.**

## What these tools do

The scripts in **external-and-mods/ufs-install** repartition the **internal UFS** storage on Qualcomm SM8650 handhelds (KONKR Pocket FIT; AYANEO Pocket S2 untested) to install **this project's SteamOS** alongside **Android**, using a **ROCKNIX ABL** dual-boot layout with **three Linux partitions** (`ROCKNIX` + `STORAGE` + `HOME`).

This is **not** a supported manufacturer procedure. It is an **experimental community tool**.

## Data loss

Running `install-masios-to-internal.sh` (unless using `--resume` / `--deploy-only` on **existing** SteamOS 3-partition layouts only):

- **Wipes Android `userdata`** — all apps, photos, game saves, accounts, and settings on internal Android storage are **permanently erased** (equivalent to repartition + factory reset).
- **May destroy other data** on internal UFS if the partition table is modified incorrectly.
- **Does not automatically back up** your microSD Linux system before copying it to UFS.

**Back up anything important before proceeding.**

## Boot failure risk

After installation or a failed attempt:

- **Android may not boot** until you perform a **factory data reset** from recovery (expected after userdata wipe).
- **Linux may not boot** from microSD or from internal UFS if the kernel, partitions, or cmdline are wrong (black screen, hang, etc.).
- **Both systems can fail** at the same time, leaving the device unusable without recovery steps (recovery mode, SD boot, ABL “UNINSTALL CFW”, EDL flash, etc.).

## Requirements (your responsibility)

- **ROCKNIX ABL** already installed and working (1.1.8 or compatible).
- Boot **SteamOS from microSD** (not from UFS) when running the installer.
- A current **`/boot/KERNEL`** from this project's SM8650 kernel build (its initramfs mounts `root=PARTLABEL=STORAGE`, and the UFS drivers are built in). The installer checks both.
- Correct **ABL device profile** (“Set the Device” → your exact model).

## Your acceptance

By running these scripts, **you confirm that**:

1. You understand the risks above.
2. You have backed up data you care about.
3. You accept **full responsibility** for the outcome.
4. You will not hold the authors liable for any damage or data loss.

If you do not agree, **do not run the installer**.

## Other UFS layouts

These scripts target the **SteamOS three-partition layout** (`ROCKNIX` + `STORAGE` + `HOME`) placed directly after Android `userdata`. They **refuse** to install when any other partition already follows `userdata` (another distro, an old two-partition install, leftovers). Use ABL **UNINSTALL CFW** (and remove a leftover `HOME` if needed) before a fresh install.
